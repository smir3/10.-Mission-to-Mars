# Mission-to-Mars
Purpose:

Robin is a data scientist who does free lance astronomy in her free time. She wants to land her dream job at Nasa and so she spends alot of her free time visitng sites on space exploration, especially on the Mission to Mars. She would like to write a script that will gather all the information she searches for into one convenient location. If it is polished enough it could get Nasa's attention.

One task deliverable is to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to build a web application which will scrap data from multiple Mar's websites with the click of a button. This data will be stored in a Mondodb database, displayed on a web application using flask, and on a portfolio using bootstrap.
